SPROCKET 
Launch your ideas

SPROCKET connects thinkers and doers, champions of community, and innovators with vision and ambition with people who can help with their idea. SPROCKET is the one platform where anyone can pledge funds, time, mentorship, resources, or advice to community projects and early-stage startups. In turn, creators and founders can build their project with the help of the wider community, letting people who are interested reach out and contribute insights, advice, and time to get the launch the idea to something so much more.
